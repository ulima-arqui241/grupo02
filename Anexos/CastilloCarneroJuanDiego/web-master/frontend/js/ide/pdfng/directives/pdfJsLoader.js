 * The PDF.js worker needs to be loaded in a Web Worker. This can be done
 * automatically with webpack via worker-loader.
 * PDF.js has the above file to do this, however it uses the webpack loader
 * module loading syntax, which prevents us from customising the loader.
 * We need to output the worker file to the public/js directory, and so we need
 * to customise the loader's options. However the rest of the file is identical
 * to the one provided by PDF.js.
